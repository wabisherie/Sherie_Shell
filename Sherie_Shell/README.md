0x16. C - Simple Shell 
Group Project

In this project our two person team will create a simple shell using C.

The very first task is to write beautiful code that passes all betty checks.

The second task is to write a UNIX CLI which displays a prompt and waits for user input, reads it and then outputs something.
If an executable cant be found, our CLI will print out an error.
It should also know how to handle errors as well as EOF.

Next we will ensure the shell can handle arguments, PATH, exit and env.

There are a number of advanced tasks we might get to working on too.

Watch how we code :-)

M.S + W.S

HOW IT WORKS

To compile, use the following script
 gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o Sash

Afterwards you will see the new shell which Wabi Sherie and Mutua Solomon have dubbed Sash.

To use it,
	./Sash
